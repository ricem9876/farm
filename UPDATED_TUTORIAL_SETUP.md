# UPDATED TUTORIAL SETUP - Using Existing UIs

## ✨ Tutorial Order (Adapted to Your Game)

1. **Open Weapon Storage** → Player presses E at weapon chest
2. **Equip Pistol** → Player clicks pistol in storage
3. **Kill all enemies in Level 1** → Player completes Farm - 1
4. **Return to Safehouse** → Player exits back to safehouse
5. **Press K to open Skill Tree** → Uses your existing SkillTreeUI
6. **Press E near Records Book** → Uses your existing Records interaction
7. **Check Weapon Storage** → Player opens storage again
8. **Tutorial Complete!** → Ready to play

## 📝 Changes Made to Match Your Setup

### What I Changed:
- ✅ Removed custom UpgradeStatsUI (you have SkillTreeUI)
- ✅ Removed custom RecordsBookUI (you have Records interaction)
- ✅ Tutorial now uses **K key** for Skill Tree (your existing binding)
- ✅ Tutorial now uses **E near Records** (your existing interaction)
- ✅ No new input actions needed!

### Files You Can DELETE:
These are no longer needed since you have existing UIs:
- ❌ `Resources/UI/UpgradeStatsUI.gd` (delete)
- ❌ `Resources/UI/UpgradeStatsUI.tscn` (delete)
- ❌ `Resources/UI/RecordsBookUI.gd` (created earlier, not needed)
- ❌ `Resources/UI/RecordsBookUI.tscn` (created earlier, not needed)

### Files You KEEP:
- ✅ `IntroTutorial.gd` (UPDATED - make this autoload!)
- ✅ `FarmLevelManager.gd`
- ✅ `farm.gd`
- ✅ `TutorialDebugMenu.gd` (optional)
- ✅ All modified files (safehouse.gd, etc.)

## ⚙️ Simple Setup (3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Add IntroTutorial Autoload
```
1. Project → Project Settings → Autoload
2. Path: res://Resources/Scripts/IntroTutorial.gd  
3. Node Name: IntroTutorial
4. Click Add
```

### Step 2: Attach farm.gd to Farm Scene
```
1. Open farm.tscn
2. Select root node
3. Attach farm.gd script
4. Save
```

### Step 3: Test!
```
Start new game - tutorial should begin!
```

## ✅ No Input Actions Needed!

Your game already has:
- ✅ K key opens Skill Tree
- ✅ E key for interactions (weapon chest, records book)

Tutorial works with your existing controls!

## 🎮 Testing the Tutorial

1. **Start New Game** → See "Open Weapon Storage"
2. **Press E at chest** → Opens storage, see "Equip Pistol"
3. **Click Pistol** → Equips, see "Kill enemies"
4. **Select Farm - 1** → Level loads
5. **Kill all enemies** → See "Return to Safehouse"
6. **Return** → See "Press K for Skill Tree"
7. **Press K** → Skill tree opens, see "Open Records"
8. **Press E near Records** → Opens records, see "Check Storage"
9. **Open chest again** → Tutorial completes!

## 🔧 How It Works With Your UIs

### Skill Tree (Step 5):
- Tutorial watches for your SkillTreeUI to become visible
- When K is pressed and tree opens → tutorial advances
- No modifications to your SkillTreeUI needed!

### Records Book (Step 6):
- Tutorial monitors when StatsBookUI opens
- When E is pressed near Records → book opens → tutorial advances
- No modifications to your Records needed!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tutorial won't detect Skill Tree opening:
**Solution:** Make sure SkillTreeUI is in the scene hierarchy when safehouse loads

### Tutorial won't detect Records opening:
**Solution:** Check that Records book creates StatsBookUI properly

### Still having issues:
Check console for these messages:
```
✓ IntroTutorial autoload ready
✓ Intro tutorial initialized
✓ Tutorial setup for safehouse
```

## 📊 Your Scene Tree is Perfect!

Your safehouse.tscn already has:
- ✅ WeaponStora (weapon storage UI)
- ✅ Records (records book interaction)
- ✅ CanvasLayer with SkillTreeUI

Tutorial integrates seamlessly!

## 🚀 You're Ready!

Just add IntroTutorial as autoload and you're done!

**Tutorial works with your existing game systems - no UI changes needed!**

## 🐛 COMMON MISTAKES:

❌ Forgetting to call register_character()
✅ Always call it after creating character

❌ Using same character_id twice
✅ Make each ID unique ("hero", "warrior", "ninja")

❌ Wrong item names
✅ Use exact names: "Wood", "Wolf Fur", "Plant Fiber", "Mushroom"

❌ Portrait path wrong
✅ Use exact path: preload("res://Resources/UI/portrait.png")

❌ Stat values too extreme
✅ Test small changes first (1.2x instead of 5.0x)

# ✅ LOOT SPARKLE MOVED TO DROPPED ITEMS!

## What Changed:

### ❌ Removed from WeaponChest.gd:
- Removed loot sparkle preload
- Removed `_spawn_loot_sparkle()` function
- Removed sparkle spawn from `_ready()`

### ✅ Added to ItemPickup.gd:
- Added loot sparkle preload
- Added `_spawn_loot_sparkle()` function
- Sparkles spawn on all dropped items!

---

## 🎮 Now Loot Sparkles Appear On:

- ✨ Mushrooms dropped by enemies
- ✨ Fiber dropped by plants
- ✨ Fur dropped by wolves
- ✨ Wood dropped by trees
- ✨ Any other items that drop

**Weapon chests** no longer have sparkles!

---

## 🎨 How It Works:

When an item spawns (via `ItemSpawner.spawn_item()`):
1. ItemPickup is instantiated
2. In `_ready()`, `_spawn_loot_sparkle()` is called
3. Golden sparkles appear above the item
4. Sparkles move with the item (including magnet pull)
5. Sparkles disappear when item is picked up

---

## ✨ Features:

- **Position**: Sparkles float 10 pixels above item
- **Movement**: Sparkles follow item (attached as child)
- **Continuous**: Always emitting (never stops)
- **Z-Index**: 5 (above item sprite)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removed with item when picked up

---

## 🔧 Customizing:

### Change sparkle position:
In `ItemPickup.gd`, find:
```gdscript
sparkle_effect.position = Vector2(0, -10)
```
Change `-10` to higher/lower value

### Make sparkles bigger:
Open `Resources/Effects/LootSparkle.tscn`:
- Select GPUParticles2D
- Increase **Amount** (currently 36)
- Increase **Scale Max** (currently 0.8)

### Change sparkle color:
Open `Resources/Effects/LootSparkle.tscn`:
- Select GPUParticles2D
- Click **Process Material**
- Find **Color Ramp**
- Adjust gradient colors

## 🎯 Test It:

1. **Save files** (Ctrl+S)
2. **Run game** (F5)
3. **Kill an enemy** → They drop items
4. **See golden sparkles** on dropped items! ✨
5. **Pick up item** → Sparkles disappear

## 📝 Files Modified:

- ✅ `Resources/Weapon/WeaponChest.gd` - Removed sparkles
- ✅ `Resources/Inventory/Items/ItemPickup.gd` - Added sparkles

---

## 💡 Why This Is Better:

- **Dropped items are easy to find** - Sparkles draw your attention
- **Weapon chest doesn't need sparkles** - It's a static object you know where it is
- **More rewarding** - Items from kills feel special with sparkles
- **Performance friendly** - Only active dropped items have sparkles

**Sparkles now appear on all dropped loot!** 🎉✨

## 🎯 Three Ways to Add Particles

### Method 1: Direct in Scene (Easiest)
**Best for:** Unique, one-off effects attached to objects

1. Add GPUParticles2D as child node in your scene
2. Configure in Inspector
3. Reference in script: `@onready var particles = $ParticlesNode`
4. Trigger with: `particles.restart()`

**Example:**
```gdscript
# Gun.gd
@onready var muzzle_flash = $MuzzleFlash

func shoot():
    muzzle_flash.restart()
```

---

### Method 2: Using EffectsManager (Recommended)
**Best for:** Frequently spawned effects that need pooling

1. Create particle scene (e.g., BulletImpact.tscn)
2. Add to EffectsManager.gd preload dictionary
3. Call from anywhere: `EffectsManager.play_effect("effect_name", position)`

**Example:**
```gdscript
# Bullet.gd
func _on_hit():
    EffectsManager.play_effect("bullet_impact", global_position)
    queue_free()
```

---

### Method 3: Programmatic Creation (Advanced)
**Best for:** Simple effects or testing without creating scenes

Use EffectsManager helper functions:

```gdscript
# Quick impact effect
EffectsManager.create_simple_impact(position, Color.YELLOW, 10)

# Blood splatter
EffectsManager.create_blood_splatter(position)

# Sparkles
EffectsManager.create_sparkle(position)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Add EffectsManager as Autoload
- Project → Project Settings → Autoload
- Path: `res://Resources/Effects/EffectsManager.gd`
- Name: `EffectsManager`
- Click Add

### Step 2: Open Your Gun Scene
- Right-click gun node → Add Child Node
- Choose: GPUParticles2D
- Rename to: MuzzleFlash
- Position at barrel tip

### Step 3: Configure Muzzle Flash
Inspector settings:
- Amount: 6
- Lifetime: 0.15
- One Shot: ✓
- Explosiveness: 1.0
- Process Material: New ParticleProcessMaterial
  - Emission Shape: Point
  - Direction: (1, 0, 0)
  - Spread: 30
  - Initial Velocity: 200-350

### Step 4: Add Code
In Gun.gd:
```gdscript
@onready var muzzle_flash = $MuzzleFlash

func shoot():
    # Your existing code...
    muzzle_flash.restart()
```

### Step 5: Test!
Run your game and shoot - you should see a flash!

## 🎨 Recommended First Effects

### Priority 1 (Add First):
1. **Muzzle Flash** - Makes shooting feel punchy
2. **Bullet Impact** - Visual feedback for hits
3. **Enemy Death** - Satisfying kill feedback

### Priority 2 (Add Next):
4. **Loot Sparkle** - Draw attention to items
5. **Walking Dust** - Adds life to movement
6. **Damage Numbers** (optional particles for numbers)

### Priority 3 (Polish):
7. **Screen shake** (not particles, but pairs well)
8. **Weapon trails**
9. **Environmental effects**
10. **UI feedback particles**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't see particles | Check Z-index, verify Emitting is true |
| Particles too fast | Reduce Initial Velocity |
| Particles too slow | Increase Initial Velocity |
| Wrong direction | Adjust Direction vector |
| Too scattered | Reduce Spread value |
| Not enough particles | Increase Amount |
| Lag/performance drop | Reduce Amount and Lifetime |
| Particles don't disappear | Check Lifetime, enable One Shot |
| No variety | Add randomness with Min/Max values |

## 📝 Code Snippets Cheat Sheet

### Trigger One-Shot Effect:
```gdscript
particles.restart()
```

### Start Continuous Effect:
```gdscript
particles.emitting = true
```

### Stop Continuous Effect:
```gdscript
particles.emitting = false
```

### Spawn Effect at Position:
```gdscript
var effect = EFFECT_SCENE.instantiate()
get_parent().add_child(effect)
effect.global_position = position
effect.emitting = true
```

### Use EffectsManager:
```gdscript
EffectsManager.play_effect("effect_name", position)
```

### Create Quick Impact:
```gdscript
EffectsManager.create_simple_impact(position, Color.RED, 15)
```

### Auto-Remove Particle After Playing:
```gdscript
var particles = create_particles()
particles.finished.connect(particles.queue_free)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with defaults** - Get something working first, polish later
2. **Copy working effects** - Once you have one good effect, duplicate and modify
3. **Use reference** - Look at other games for inspiration
4. **Iterate quickly** - Adjust values in real-time while game runs
5. **Keep it simple** - A few good effects > many bad effects
6. **Performance matters** - Test on slower hardware
7. **Particle textures** - A simple white circle PNG works for 90% of effects
8. **Color is key** - The right color makes or breaks the effect
9. **Less is more** - Too many particles looks messy
10. **Sound + particles** - Combine with audio for best impact!

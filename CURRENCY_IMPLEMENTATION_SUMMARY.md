## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Usage
```gdscript
# Get currency count
var coins = inventory.count_item_by_name("Coin")
var tech = inventory.count_item_by_name("Tech Point")

# Check if can afford
if inventory.has_enough_items("Coin", 100):
    print("Can afford!")

# Spend currency
if inventory.remove_item_by_name("Coin", 100):
    print("Purchased!")
```

### Give Currency
```gdscript
# Give coins to player
player.collect_item("coin")

# Or give multiple at once
var coin_item = player._create_item_from_name("coin")
player.add_item_to_inventory(coin_item, 100)
```

### Drop Currency from Enemies
```gdscript
var pickup = preload("res://Resources/Inventory/ItemPickup.tscn").instantiate()
pickup.item_name = "coin"  # or "techpoint"
pickup.global_position = enemy.global_position
get_tree().current_scene.add_child(pickup)
```

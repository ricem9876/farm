# Key Forge UI - Camera Zoom Fix

## Issue
The Key Forge UI was appearing huge because the player camera is zoomed 3x. UI elements were being affected by the camera zoom.

## Solution
Wrapped the UI in a **CanvasLayer** node. CanvasLayers render independently of the camera and are not affected by camera transforms (position, rotation, or zoom).

## Changes Made

### Scene Structure (KeyForgeUI.tscn)
**Old Structure:**
```
KeyForgeUI (Control)
└── Background (PanelContainer)
    └── ...
```

**New Structure:**
```
KeyForgeUI (CanvasLayer)
└── Control
    └── Background (PanelContainer)
        └── ...
```

### Script Updates (KeyForgeUI.gd)

1. **Changed base class:**
   - `extends Control` → `extends CanvasLayer`

2. **Updated node references:**
   - Added: `@onready var control_node = $Control`
   - Updated all paths: `$Background` → `$Control/Background`

3. **Modified _ready() function:**
   - Removed anchor/scale setup from CanvasLayer (doesn't support these)
   - Apply scale to child Control node instead
   - Control node: `scale = Vector2(0.5, 0.5)` for proper sizing

## How It Works

**CanvasLayer Properties:**
- Renders on its own layer, independent of the game world
- Not affected by Camera2D zoom, position, or rotation
- Perfect for UI elements that should stay consistent
- Has a `layer` property to control render order

**Why This Fixes the Issue:**
- Camera zoom of 3x was making UI 3x larger
- CanvasLayer ignores camera transforms
- UI now renders at intended size regardless of camera zoom

## Technical Details

The control node inside the CanvasLayer:
- Fills the entire viewport (PRESET_FULL_RECT)
- Scaled to 0.5 (UI_SCALE constant) for appropriate size
- Uses TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST for pixel-perfect rendering

## Testing

1. Open Key Forge UI (press E at Key Forge)
2. UI should now be appropriately sized
3. Camera zoom should not affect UI size
4. UI should be centered on screen

## Other UIs to Check

If you have other UIs affected by camera zoom, apply the same fix:
1. Make root node a CanvasLayer
2. Add a Control child node
3. Update script to extend CanvasLayer
4. Update node references in script
5. Apply scaling to Control node, not CanvasLayer

**UIs that might need this fix:**
- InventoryUI
- WeaponStorageUI
- PauseMenu
- Any other UI that appears too large/small
